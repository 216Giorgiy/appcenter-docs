# Identity

Azure Identity enables user authentication for your app without changes to the app backend. It helps protect your application and work with per-user data seamlessly. It is powered by [Azure App Service Authentication / Authorization].

The feature support the following identity providers:
* Azure Active Directory
* Facebook
* Google
* Microsoft Account
* Twitter

You can use multiple providers in a single app, and can choose to utilize client-controlled or server-controlled authentication flow.
* Client flow (recommended): Use an SDK that a given identity provider publishes to establish identity and then gain access to Azure â€“ this allows for better use experience and easier consumption of provider graph APIs.
* Server flow: Use a single line of code from the Azure Identity client SDK to sign in users.
