# Identity

Azure Identity enables user authentication for your app without changes to the app backend. It helps protect your application and work with per-user data seamlessly. It is powered by [Azure App Service Authentication / Authorization].

The feature support the following identity providers:
* Azure Active Directory
* Facebook
* Google
* Microsoft Account
* Twitter

You can use multiple providers in a single app, and can choose to utilize client-controlled or server-controlled authentication flow.
* Client flow (recommended): Use an SDK that a given identity provider publishes to establish identity and then gain access to Azure â€“ this allows for better use experience and easier consumption of provider graph APIs.
* Server flow: Use a single line of code from the Azure Identity client SDK to sign in users.


## **Getting Started**

1.  Configure your app with a desired identity provider and establish trust with Mobile Center:
    * [Azure Active Directory]
    * [Facebook]
    * [Google]
    * [Microsoft Account]
    * [Twitter]
2.  Configure your app client to see Identity at work!
    * [iOS][iOS] (Swift or Obj-C)
    * [Android]
