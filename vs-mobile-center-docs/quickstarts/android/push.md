# Send Push Notifications to Users
First, follow the [getting started tutorial](getting-started.md) to set up the sample app.

### Prerequisites
 - Signed APK.
 - Distributed sample app to your device (not running on emulator).
 - Google account.

## Integrate App Center SDK
*The following directions are also located in the push service on App Center.*
1. Locate the following in **app/build.gradle** and add the compile statement:

``` java
dependencies {  
      def appCenterSdkVersion = '1.0.0'
      compile "com.microsoft.appcenter:appcenter-push:${appCenterSdkVersion}"
}
```

2. Locate the App Center import statement in **MainActivity.java** and add the push import statement below it:

```java
import com.microsoft.appcenter.AppCenter;
import com.microsoft.appcenter.push.Push;
```

3. Locate **onCreate** and add `Push.class` to `AppCenter.start`:

```java
AppCenter.start(getApplication(), "<APP SECRET HERE>",
         Analytics.class, Crashes.class, Push.class);
```

## Use Firebase Assistant to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging
1. Navigate to the app in Android Studio.
2. Go to the Firebase Assistant from the tool bar by clicking on **Tools > Firebase**.
3. Click on Cloud Messaging and click on **Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging**.
4. Connect your app to Firebase.
5. Add Firebase Cloud Messaging to your app. Ignore all other steps in the Firebase Assistant.
6. The App Center SDK manages the following for you; if added automatically, please remove to avoid errors:

```java
  compile "com.google.firebase:firebase-core:${version}"
  compile "com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:${version}"
```
