# Log Flow Page

Log Flow will show you in real time what is being received by the backend.
The main goals are:
- Check the SDK is properly wired and our backend is receiving data, as you might do a microphone check: "Is this on?"
- Ensure the backend is receiving what the app is supposed to send

## General information

Log Flow will collect and display incoming data from the current day (in the UTC timezone). The data should appear within a few seconds after it is sent by the device. It will automatically refresh every 3 seconds, and will load up to 100 data points. If more than 100 data points were generated by the application between 2 refreshes, the UI will indicate the "break" with an icon. 

In order to populate the log flow page, you will need to:
1. Open the Log Flow page and wait a few seconds
2. Start sending logs from your device

No previous logs will show unless this workflow above was done earlier in the same day (in the UTC timezone). Also, this process will need to be done again after 10 minutes of the page not being in focus.

It is possible to view:
- Start of sessions
- The fact that a crash occured
- Events, including the event name and its properties

All data includes a subset of the _installation id_ which uniquely identifies devices and the time in local timezone at which the log was emited in the application.

## "Is this on?"
The main use case of Log Flow is to check that "the SDK integration works". Data will appear within seconds there, so it's the best way to check whether your 1-line integration worked after the first run.

When doing a 1-line integration, you should expect a "STARTSESSION" with the session Id, everytime the app is started.

## Checking the data received
The other use case is to check that the Mobile Center backend receives exactly the events with the names and properties that are expected to send.

It is a good idea to check the SDK integration, and especially Events by going through all the features and actions that are instrumented, in order to check that Mobile Center properly receives what is expected.
