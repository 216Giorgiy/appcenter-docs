# Getting Started by Creating App and Codesigning

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a sample Android app with Mobile Center.

### Prerequisite Steps
- Create [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
- [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and [install it on your local machine](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html).

## Login to Github and fork the repository
1. Login to your [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
2. Access the [sample app's GitHub repository](https://github.com/MobileCenter/sampleapp-android).
3. Click **Fork** at the top right hand corner of the page.


## Sign in to Mobile Center
1. Open the [Mobile Center portal](https://mobile.azure.com).
2. Click **Connect with GitHub** and log in, or use another provider.

## Create a new app in Mobile Center
1. Click **Add new app**.
2. Name the app **Sample Android App**.
3. Choose **Android** and **Java** respectively.
4. Click **Add new app**.

## Replace the App Secret

In order for the sample app to send information to Mobile Center, the app secret must be changed to match the one provided for your specific Mobile Center project.

1. Navigate to **Settings** in Mobile Center.
2. Copy the **App Secret** at the top of the page.

3. Go into the **sampleapp_android** repository and navigate into **MainActivity.java**, located in /app/src/main/java/com/example/mobilecenter/sampleapp_android.
4. In **MainActivity.java**, locate the following:
```
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        MobileCenter.start(getApplication(), "<APP SECRET HERE>",
                Analytics.class, Crashes.class);
```
5. Replace  `<APP SECRET HERE>` with your unique app secret.

5. **Add, commit, and push changes to your forked repository.** This can be done from the terminal, or a tool of your choice.

## Sign the Android Package Kit (APK)

*This section is optional, but recommended.*

In order to run tests, distribute the app to users, and send push notifications, the APK must be digitally signed with a certificate. After creating an App ID for the sample app, follow the steps below to manually sign the APK. To learn what a digital certificate is, or for signing options other than the one outlined below, refer to the [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#sign-auto).

  1. Open Android Studio and click **Open an existing Android Studio project**.
  2. Navigate to the forked sample app android repository location on your machine.
  3. Go to **Build > Generate Signed APK** from the menu bar.
  4. Leave **Module: app** and click Next.
  5. In **Key store path**, click **Create new...** and create the keystore as per the following image from the [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#sign-auto):

  3. Edit the **Bundle Identifier** to match the app ID.
  4. Select **Automatically manage signing** to point to Xcode to a certificate installed on your machine. Also, be sure to select your team below.
  5. **Add, commit, and push changes to your forked repository.** This can be done from the terminal, or a tool of your choice.
