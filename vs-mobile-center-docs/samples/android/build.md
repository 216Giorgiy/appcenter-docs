# Build Sample Android App on Mobile Center

### Prerequisites
- Follow the [getting started tutorial](getting-started.md) to set up the sample app.
- Optional: signed APK. Go to the [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to learn about creating a new keystore and manually signing an APK.

## Set up the repository
1. Go to the **Build** service in [Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com/apps).
2. Choose **GitHub** as the selected service.
3. Sign in to GitHub, and click **Authorize MobileCenter**.
4. Choose **sampleapp-android**.

## Configure the build
1. Choose the **master** branch.
2. Click **Configure build**. The Build configuration panel will show up.
3. The default setting for build frequency is **Build this branch on every push**. Every time you push code to a configured branch, a build will automatically begin. You can enable this continuous integration feature or opt to manually choose when builds run.

4. If you want to run the build on a device, turn **Sign builds** on. If you followed the instructions on **Getting Started**, you can upload your keystore file and fill in the environment variables or check **My Gradle settings are entirely set to handle signing automatically**.
5. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page, and the build will begin.

The build can take a couple minutes, but you can click on it to view real-time output logs. After, if the build is successful, you can download the build, symbols, or logs by clicking **Download**.
