# Analytics

In this tutorial, you will allow data from your app to show up on the Mobile Center Analytics page.

## Start the SDK
1. Obtain the **App Secret** unique to your app by navigating to the **Settings** page in Mobile Center. Once in **Settings**, find the app secret by following the arrow in the picture below:

2. Navigate to the **AppDelegate.swift** file. Go to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method and locate the following:
```
MSMobileCenter.start("{Your App Secret}", withServices: [
      MSAnalytics.self,
      MSCrashes.self,
      MSPush.self
  ])
```
3. Make sure ``{Your App Secret}`` is consistent with what is shown on the Mobile Center portal.
4. Build and launch your app.
