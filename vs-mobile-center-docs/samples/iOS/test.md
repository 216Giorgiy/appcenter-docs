# Test

We've included XCUITests with the sample app. In this tutorial, you will learn to run the UI tests using Mobile Center.

First, follow the [getting started tutorial](/getting-started.md) to set up the sample app.

### Prerequisites
- Provisioning Profile and Certificate

## Install Mobile Center Command Line Interface

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6.3 or later.
2. Open the terminal and run this to install the Mobile Center CLI:
```shell
npm install -g mobile-center-cli
```
3. Run this and follow the directions to log in to Mobile Center:
```shell
mobile-center login
```

## Codesign the project <!-- UPDATE THIS -->
1. Open **.xcworkspace** from the sample app's folder.
2. Go to **General** within the .xcodeproj file and changing the information under the **Signing** tabs.
3. Select **Automatically manage signing** to point to XCode to a certificate installed on your machine.  
<!--4. Change "Provisioning Profile" to match your own. 5. Go to the **Build Settings** tab and go to **Signing**, then **Code Signing Identity**. Change the selection for all four tabs under Code Signing Identity (Debug, Any iOS SDK, Release, Any iOS SDK) to your unique identity in keychain. 6. Change **Deployment Team** to your own and **Provisioning Profile** to your provisioning profile. 7. Going to **General** within the .xcodeproj file, going to the first subsection, **Identity** and changing the information for **Bundle Identifier**. Use the bundle associated with the app in your Apple Developer account. See additional information [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingProfiles/MaintainingProfiles.html).-->

## Make the test folder
1. Open a terminal and go to the project directory.
2. Run this to remove the derivedDataPath if it exists:
 ```shell
 rm -rf ddp
 ```
3. Run this to make the build folder for tests:
 ```shell
 xcrun xcodebuild build-for-testing -configuration Debug -workspace demoapp-ios-swift.xcworkspace -sdk iphoneos -scheme demoapp-ios-swift -derivedDataPath ddp
 ```

## Prepare to run tests in Mobile Center
1. Go to the **Test** service in [Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com/apps).
2. Click on **Start testing your app**.
3. Select the first device, the **Apple iPhone 7 Plus**, and press **Select one device** at the bottom.
