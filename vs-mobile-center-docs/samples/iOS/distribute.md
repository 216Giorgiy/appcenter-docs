# Distribute
In this tutorial, you will learn to distribute a sample iOS app to a group of users, who can install the app on their device.

If you have not already, first follow the [getting started tutorial](/getting-started.md) to set up the sample app.


### Prerequisites
- Code signed (optional)

## Create a distribution group
1. Navigate to the **Distribute** service on the [Mobile Center portal](https://mobile.azure.com/apps).
2. Click **New Group** at the top of the page.
3. Name the group **Beta Testers** and add your email in the invitation box below.
4. Press **Create Group**.

## Distribute the sample app
There are **two ways you can distribute** the app.

If you already completed the [Build tutorial](/build.md) and built the sample app:
1. From the **Distribute** service, select the **Beta Testers** distribution group you just made.
2. Click **Distribute new release** at the top of the page.
3. Choose **Select Build from branch**.
4. Choose the **master** branch.

5. Click on the latest successful and signed build. If there isn't a build, then you haven't signed your builds. The [Build tutorial](/build.md) has steps to do so.
6. Click **Next** twice. Leave the **Release notes** blank.
7. Click **Distribute build**.
