# Distribute
In this tutorial, you will learn to distribute a sample iOS app to a group of users, who can install the app on their device.

If you have not already, first follow the [getting started tutorial](/getting-started.md) to set up the sample app.


### Prerequisites
- Code signed (optional)

## Choose a build to Distribute
There are **two ways you can distribute** the app.

If you already completed the [Build tutorial](/build.md) and built the sample app:
1. From the **Distribute** service, select the **Beta Testers** distribution group you just made.
2. Click **Distribute new release** at the top of the page.
3. Choose **Select Build from branch**.
4. Choose the **master** branch.

5. Click on the latest successful and signed build. If there isn't a build, then you haven't signed your builds. The [Build tutorial](/build.md) has steps to do so.
6. Click **Next** twice. Leave the **Release notes** blank.

Another way is to upload your own .ipa file from XCode:
1. From the **Distribute** service, select the **Beta Testers** distribution group you just made.
2. Click **Distribute new release** at the top of the page.
3. Choose **Select Build from branch**.

4. Upload your **.ipa** file.
5. Click **Next** twice. Leave the **Release notes** blank.


## Distribute the app
2. Click **New distribution group**.
3. Name the group **Beta Testers** and add your email in the invitation box below.
4. Press **Create Group**.
6. Click **Next** twice and then **Distribute build**.

By creating groups of users, you can easily distribute to them all at once, and add new testers when needed.

## Install the sample app
1. You should receive an email with a link to download the sample app.
2. Open the link and follow the instructions to register your device with Mobile Center, and the app will begin installing.
