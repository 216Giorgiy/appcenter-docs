# Crashes

Mobile Center Crash Reporting lets developers collect crashes in their apps whether they occur in testing or in production.

# Key Features

Crashes are grouped together by similarities like the reason for the crash and where the occur in the app. It is possible to inspect each individual crash report for the last 3 months, after that a stub of 25 crashes will be kept.



# Getting Started
To leverage this feature it is required to integrate the Mobile Center SDK and its crash reporting module into the app. As the SDK runs in the same process as the app, the crash report will be sent the next time the app starts.
