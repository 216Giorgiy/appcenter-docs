The Mobile Center SDK uses a modular architecture so you can use any or all of the services.

Let's get started with setting up Mobile Center Android SDK in your app to use Mobile Center Analytics and Mobile Center Crashes. 

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

* You are using a React Native project that runs React Native 0.34 or later.
* You are targeting devices that are running Android Version 4.0.3/API level 15 or later, or iOS version 8.0 or later.
* The default way to use the SDK requires [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org). Nonetheless, it is possible to link the SDK manually.

## 2. Create your app in the Mobile Center Portal to optain the App Secret

If you have already created your app in the Mobile Center portal, you can skip this step.

1. Head over to [mobile.azure.com](https://mobile.azure.com).
2. Sign up or log in and hit the blue button on the top right corner of the portal that says **Add new** and select **Add new app** from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter a name and an optional desciption for you app.
3. Select the appropriate OS (Android or iOS) and select **React Native** as the platform.
4. Hit the button at the bottom right that says **Add new app**.

Once you have created an app, you can optain it's **App Secret** on the **Getting Started** or **Manage App** sections of the Mobile Center Portal.

## 3. Add the Mobile Center SDK modules

The default integration of the SDK uses Cocoapods for iOS. If you are not using Cocoapods in your app please use integrate the iOS SDK manually.

### 3.1 Integrate the SDK automatically

#### 3.1 Add Mobile Center Analytics

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of your React Native project, enter the following lines to add Mobile Center Analytics and Mobile Center Crashes to the app:

	```
	npm install mobile-center-analytics --save
	```

2. Link the plugin to the React Native app using the react-native link command.

	```
	react-native link mobile-center-analytics
	```

3. A set of dialog will apear that asks for additional information. The first one will ask for the App Secret, which will enable Mobile Center to map this app to the right user account. The secret may already be pre-populated, showing up beside the question. If the pre-filled secret is correct, press enter to continue.

	```
	What is the Android app secret?(0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)
	```
	
	The SDK will then ask whether or not to send user events automatically. [Learn more about manually sending user events.](~/sdk/analytics/react-native.md)

	```
	For the Android app, should user tracking be enabled automatically ? (Use arrow keys)
        ❯ Enable Automatically
          Enable in JavaScript
	```
	
  There will be the same set of questions for iOS.

#### 3.1 Add Mobile Center Crashes

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of your React Native project, enter the following lines to add Mobile Center Analytics and Mobile Center Crashes to the app:

	```
	npm install mobile-center-crashes --save
	```

2. Link the plugin to the React Native app using the react-native link command.

	```
	react-native link mobile-center-crashes
	```

	A set of dialog will apear that asks for additional information. The first one will ask for the App Secret, which will enable Mobile Center to map this app to the right user account. The secret may already be pre-populated, showing up beside the question. If the pre-filled secret is correct, press enter to continue.

	```
	What is the Android app secret?(0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)
	```

	The SDK will then ask whether or not to send crash reports automatically. [Learn more about processing on crash reports in JS](~/sdk/crashes/react-native.md).

	```
	For the Android app, should crashes be sent automatically, or processed in javascript before being sent? (Use arrow keys)
        ❯ Automatically
          Processed in JavaScript by user
	```
 	
 	There will be the same set of questions for your iOS app.

### 3.2 [iOS only] Integrate the iOS SDK manually

We **strongly** recommend integrating the SDK using Cocoapods as described above. Nonetheless, it's also possible to integrate the SDK manually.

#### 3.2.1 Download the binaries

Download the [Mobile Center iOS SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/MobileCenter-SDK-iOS/releases) and the [ReactNative Mobile Center iOS SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/MobileCenter-SDK-React-Native/releases) frameworks provided as two zip files. Unzip the files and you will see different frameworks for each Mobile Center services and the ReactNative Mobile Center framework. 

#### 3.2.2 Add the binaries to your Xcode project

1. Make sure the Project Navigator is visible `(⌘+1)`. Click and drag the frameworks to your project to add them to the top level within your project.
2. A dialog will appear. Select “Create groups” and set the checkmark for “Add to targets” for your target. Then click Finish.

> **Note:** `MobileCenter.framework` is required to start the SDK. Make sure it is added to your project, otherwise the other modules won’t work and your app won’t compile.

## 4. Start the SDK

Great, you are all set to visualize Analytics and Crashes data on the portal that the SDK collects automatically. There is no additional setup required. Look at [Analytics](~/sdk/analytics/react-native.md) and [Crashes](~/sdk/crashes/react-native.md) section for APIs guides and walkthroughs to learn what Mobile Center can do.
