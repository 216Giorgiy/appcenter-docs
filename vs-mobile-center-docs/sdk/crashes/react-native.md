Mobile Center Crashes will automatically generate a crash log every time your app crashes. The log is first written to the device's storage and when the user starts the app again, the crash report will be sent to Mobile Center. Collecting crashes works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to Google Play. Crash logs contain valuable information for you to help fix the crash.

Please follow the [Getting Started](~/sdk/getting-started/react-native.md) section if you haven't set up the SDK in your application yet.

Wherever you are using Mobile Center Crashes, add the following import at the top of the file.
```javascript
// Import Mobile Center Crashes at the top of the file.
import Crashes from "mobile-center-crashes";
```

## Generate a test crash

Mobile Center Crashes provides you with an API to generate a test crash for easy testing of the SDK. This API can only be used in test/beta apps and won't do anything in production apps.

```
Crashes.generateTestCrash();
```

It's also easy to generate a JavaScript crash. Add the following line to your code, which throws a JavaScript error and causes a crash.

```javascript
throw new Error("This is a test javascript crash!");
```

> [!TIP]
> Your React Native app needs to be compiled in **release mode** for this crash to be sent to Mobile Center.

## Get more information about a previous crash

Mobile Center Crashes has two APIs that give you more information in case your app has crashed.

### Did the app crash in the previous session?

At any time after starting the SDK, you can check if the app crashed in the previous launch:

```javascript
const didCrash = await Crashes.hasCrashedInLastSession();
```

This comes in handy in case you want to adjust the behavior or UI of your app after a crash has occured. Some developers chose to show additional UI to apologize to their users, or want way to get in touch after a crash has occured.

### Details about the last crash

If your app crashed previously, you can get details about the last crash.

```javascript
const crashReport = await Crashes.lastSessionCrashReport();
```

## Customize your usage of Mobile Center Crashes

Mobile Center Crashes provides callbacks for developers to perform additional actions before and when sending crash logs to Mobile Center.

### <a name="process"></a> Processing crashes in JavaScript

During `react-native link`, the SDK will ask whether or not to send crash reports automatically or process crashes in JavaScript. Opting to process crashes first means more work for the developer, but greater control over user privacy and allows you to attach a message with a crash report.

Processing a crash in JavaScript requires you to use the `process` method from Mobile Center Crashes.

```javascipt
// import the Crashes library at the top of the file
import Crashes from "mobile-center-crashes";
```

Then, you can send all crashes that have been queued up since the last call to `process` or discard them.

The following example shows how to handle a user confirmation dialog:

```javascript
    Crashes.process((reports, send) => {
      if (reports.length > 0) {
        Alert.alert(
          `Send ${reports.length} crash(es)?`,
          '',
          [
            { text: 'Send', onPress: () => send(true) },
            { text: 'Ignore', onPress: () => send(false), style: 'cancel' },
          ],
          { cancelable: false }
        );
      }
    });
```

### Get information about the sending status for a crash log

At times, you would like to know the status of your app crash. A common use case is that you might want to show UI that tells the users that your app is submitting a crash report, or, in case your app is crashing very quickly after the launch, you want to adjust the behavior of the app to make sure the crash logs can be submitted. Mobile Center Crashes has three different callbacks that you can use in your app to be notified of what is going on.

To do that you have to define an event listener in your code as in the following example:

```javascript
      Crashes.setEventListener({
        willSendCrash: function (report) {
            // called after Crashes.process and before sending the crash.
        },
        didSendCrash: function (report) {
            // called when crash report sent successfully.
        },
        failedSendingCrash: function (report) {
            // called when crash report could not be sent.
        }
      });
```

All callbacks are optional. You don't have to provide all 3 methods in the event listener object, for example you can implement only `willSendCrash`.

> [!NOTE]
> To use that feature you need to have answered **Processed in JavaScript by user** when executing `react-native link` for the Crash service configuration.
>
> This feature is thus dependent on [Processing crashes in JavaScript](#process).

If you configure crashes to be sent automatically, you will likely register the listener too late and thus the crashes would already be sent before Javascript loads your custom code.

Thus you should configure crashes to be processed in Javascript and set up the event listener before calling `Crashes.process`.

### Add attachments to a crash report

You can add **one binary** and **one text** attachment to a crash report. The SDK will send it along with the crash so that you can see it in Mobile Center portal.

> [!NOTE]
> To use that feature you need to have answered **Processed in JavaScript by user** when executing `react-native link` for the Crash service configuration.
>
> This feature is thus dependent on [Processing crashes in JavaScript](#process).

```javascript
    Crashes.process(function (reports, send) {
      for (const report of reports) {
        report.addTextAttachment("Hello text attachment!", "hello.txt");
        report.addBinaryAttachment(`${imageAsBase64string}`, "logo.png", "image/png");
      }
      send(true);
    });
```

## Enable or disable Mobile Center Crashes at runtime

You can enable and disable Mobile Center Crashes at runtime. If you disable it, the SDK will not do any crash reporting for the app.

```javascript
await Crashes.setEnabled(false);
```

To enable Mobile Center Crashes again, use the same API but pass `true` as a parameter.

```javascript
await Crashes.setEnabled(true);
```

## Check if Mobile Center Crashes is enabled

You can also check if Mobile Center Crashes is enabled or not:

```java
const enabled = await Crashes.isEnabled();
```
