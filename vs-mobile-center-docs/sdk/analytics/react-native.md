Mobile Center Analytics helps you understand user behavior and customer engagement to improve your app. The SDK automatically captures session count, device properties like model, OS version, etc. You can define your own custom events to measure things that matter to you. All the information captured is available in the Mobile Center portal for you to analyze the data.

Please follow the [Get started](~/sdk/get-started/react-native.md) section if you haven't set up and started the SDK in your application yet.

## 1. Session and device information

Once you add Mobile Center Analytics to your app and the SDK is started, it will automatically track sessions and device properties like OS Version, model, etc. You don’t need to add any additional code.

## 2. Custom events

You can track your own custom events with **up to five properties** to know what's happening in your app, understand user actions, and see the aggregates in the Mobile Center portal.

Once you have started the SDK, use the `trackEvent:withProperties` method to track your events with properties. You can send **up to 200 distinct event names**. Also, note that there is a maximum of 256 characters supported per event name and 64 characters per event property name and event property value.

```
// import Mobile Center Analytics at the top of the file.
import Analytics from "mobile-center-analytics";

Analytics.trackEvent(String name, Map<String,String> properties);
```

This function returns a promise, in which the success case returns an empty string, and the error case returns the error.

Properties for events are entirely optional. If you just want to track an event, use this sample instead:

```
Analytics.trackEvent("My first event");
```

For more information about custom events in Mobile Center, go to [Events Metrics](~/analytics/understand-events.md).

## 3. Enable or disable Mobile Center Analytics at runtime

You can enable and disable Mobile Center Analytics at runtime. If you disable it, the SDK will not collect any more analytics information for the app.

```
Analytics.setEnabled(false);
```

This function returns a promise, in which the success case returns an empty string, and the error case returns the error.

To enable Mobile Center Analytics again, use the same API but pass `true` as a parameter.

```
Analytics.setEnabled(true);
```

## 4. Check if Mobile Center Analytics is enabled

You can also check if Mobile Center Analytics is enabled or not.

```
boolean isEnabled = Analytics.isEnabled();
```

This function returns a promise, in which the success case returns a `boolean`, and the error case returns the error.

## 5. Wait for JS to enable Mobile Center Analytics

In some cases, an application may want to ask users whether they want to share analytics information. In that case, during installation, you should select `I will manually enable events sending` during `react-native link`.

```
For the [platform] app, should user tracking be enabled automatically ? (Use arrow keys)
        ❯ Enable Automatically
          Enable in JavaScript
```

This means that for any information to be sent to Mobile Center (even basic session information), the developer must first enable Mobile Center Analytics inside the app by adding the following line to their code.

```
Analytics.setEnabled(true);
```
