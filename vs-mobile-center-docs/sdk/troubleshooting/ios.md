## Issues during setup

1. In the console, look for an Assert log with the message - "Mobile Center SDK configured successfully". This verifies that the SDK is configured successfully.
2. If you are using Cocoapods to integrate Mobile Center in your iOS app and run into an error with the message - `CocoaPods - Unable to find a specification for MobileCenter`, follow this [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40785259/cocoapods-unable-to-find-a-specification-for-mobilecenter) to fix the issue.
3. If you are manually integrating the SDK binaries, make sure you have modules enabled for your project.

## Analytics data doesn't show up in the portal

1. Make sure you have integrated the SDK modules correctly.
2. Make sure correct App Secret is included along with the `start:withServices:` method call. You can copy the exact `start:withServices:`-code by opening the app in the portal and navigating to Getting Started page.
3. In the console, look for an Assert log with the message - "Mobile Center SDK configured successfully". This verifies that the SDK is configured successfully and your logs will be forwarded.
4. If you want to see the logs that get sent to the backend, change the log level to **Verbose** in your application and the SDK will print logs in the console. Call the API below before you start the SDK.

  	```objc
  	[MSMobileCenter setLogLevel:MSLogLevelVerbose]
  	```
    ```swift
	MSMobileCenter.setLogLevel(MSLogLevel.Verbose)
	```
	
5. Make sure your device is online.
6. At times, logs might take few minutes to surface in the portal. Please wait for some time if that’s the case.
7. To check if Mobile Center backend received your data, go to the Log flow section in Analytics service. Your events should appear once it has been sent.

## Crashes don't show up in the portal

1. Make sure you have integrated the SDK modules correctly.
2. Make sure correct App Secret is included along with the `start:withServices:` method call. You can copy the exact `start:withServices:` code by opening the app in the portal and navigating to Getting Started page.
3. In the console, look for an Assert log with the message - "Mobile Center SDK configured successfully". This verifies that the SDK is configured successfully and your logs will be forwarded.
4. You need to restart the app after a crash and Mobile Center Crashes will forward the crash log only after it is restarted. Also, the SDK will not forward any crash log if you attached to be debugger. Make sure the debugger is not attached when you crash the app.
5. If you want to see the logs that get sent to the backend, change the log level to **Verbose** in your application and the SDK will print logs in the console. Call the API below before you start the SDK.

	```objc
 	[MSMobileCenter setLogLevel:MSLogLevelVerbose]
 	```
 	```swift
	MSMobileCenter.setLogLevel(MSLogLevel.Verbose)
	```

6. Don't use any other library that provides Crash Reporting functionality. You can only have one crash reporting SDK integrated in your app.
7. Make sure your device is online.
8. At times, logs might take few minutes to surface in the portal. Please wait for some time if that’s the case.
9. If you want to check if the SDK detected the crash on the next app start, you can call the API to check whether the app crashed in the last session and shows an alert. Or you can extend the crash callback to see if it was successfully sent to the server.
10. To check if Mobile Center backend received the crash, go to the Log flow section in the Analytics service. Your crashes should appear there, once it has been sent.

## The Alert that prompts users for an update doesn't contain strings, but just the keys for them?

This means that the `MobileCenterDistributeResources.bundle` wasn't added to the project. Make sure you have drag'n'dropped the file into your Xcode project, and it appears in your app target's `Copy Bundle Resources` build phase. The later should be the case if you have added the file through drag'n'drop – Xcode does it automatically for you. If the file is missing from the build phase, add it so it gets compiled into your app's bundle.

If you are using Cocoapods, it takes care of the resources automatically. Try re-installing the pod.

## You are seeing messages in the console that indicate that the database could not be opened (using SDK version 0.11.0 and later)

Starting with version 0.11.0 of the iOS SDK, Mobile Center uses SQLite to persist logs before they are sent to the backend. If you are bundling your application with your own SQLite library instead of using the one provided by the OS, you might see errors like this in the console `[MobileCenter] ERROR: -[MSDBStorage executeSelectionQuery:]/147 Failed to open database` and won't be seeing any analytics or crash information in the backend. The reason for this is that bundling your own version of SQLite is something that should be done carefully and only when necessary. Bundling your own build of SQLite requires additional measures when building and linking your own version of SQLite into your app. Eric Sink explains the issues pretty well in [this blogpost](http://ericsink.com/entries/sqlite_android_n.html) and [that one](http://ericsink.com/entries/multiple_sqlite_problem.html). 

Section 2.2.1 of the [official SQLite documentation](http://sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html#multiple_copies_of_sqlite_linked_into_the_same_application) points out that linking several SQLite databases can lead to errors. Mobile Center SDK relies on the SQLite build provided by iOS. We are investigating how we might support apps with a custom SQLite build – if this affects your applications, please contact us on Intercom by using the blue button on the bottom right of the Mobile Center portal. Learning how your application bundles and uses SQLite will help shape Mobile Center's future.

### What if I really need to ship my own version of SQLite?

If you really need to ship your custom version of SQLite with your app, you need to make sure, as pointed out above, that your custom SQLite build has hidden its symbols and isolated itself properly.

If you were to link SQLite dynamically on iOS, the following steps would be necessary: 

1. Make sure you utilize `__attribute__((visibility("hidden")))`/`-fvisibility=hidden` and `-fvisibility-inlines-hidden`to hide any API to avoid symbol collisions.
2. Leverage two-level namespaces in `dyld` which is a topic of its own and which is explained, e.g. in Apple's Guide on [Executing Mach-O Files](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachOTopics/1-Articles/executing_files.html).

As static linking is the way to go on iOS, there is really only one way to isolate your custom build of SQLite properly: Rename all the SQLite symbols manually with your own symbols.

Because of the complexities of bundling your own SQLite build, even more changes might be necessary than those outlined above. This will depend on your configuration and be different for each developer.

> [!NOTE]
> Always build your own `sqlite3.c` in **release mode**.
> Please note that building your own `sqlite3.c` should always be used in `release mode` as a build of SQLite in `debug mode` will balloon your apps' debug build by several MB instead of tens of KB.
