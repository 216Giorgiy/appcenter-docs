# SDK Limitations & Known Issues

## Limitations

### React Native

1. The React Native SDK currently does not support In-App-Updates. The reason for this is that one of React Nativeâ€™s main features is that it allows to deploy apps using [CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/) without the need to distribute a new build.

### Xamarin

1. Crashes caused by `StackOverflowException` are not reported. This is a limitation of the Xamarin runtime.
