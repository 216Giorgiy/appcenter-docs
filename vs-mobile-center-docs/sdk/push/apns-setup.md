Please configure Apple Push Notifications service (APNs) for your app from your Apple developer account and the Mobile Center portal before adding Mobile Center Push to your app. Mobile Center Push won't get any notifications if you don't setup push notifications.

1. Open Xcode to enable push notifications on your application. In the project editor, choose your target and click **Capabilities**. In the **Push Notifications** section, click the switch to turn it from OFF to ON.

On the bottom of the page select **Sandbox** for initial development or **Production** for production version of your application. You will collect the **Key ID**, **App Name**, **App ID** and **Push Token** in the next steps.

3. Go to your Apple developer account and select your application from the [App ID list](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle) in **Identifiers**. Copy the **Prefix** value from this window and paste it to the Mobile Center push settings **App ID** field. Do the same with the **ID** value to be copied to the Mobile Center push settings **App Name** field.
