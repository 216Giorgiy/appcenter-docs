App Center Push enables you to send push notifications to users of your app from the App Center portal.

## Prerequisite - Enable Apple Push Notifications service (APNs) for your app

Configure Apple Push Notifications service (APNs) for your app from your Apple developer account and App Center portal before adding App Center Push to your app.

### Enable push notifications on your application

 In Xcode's project editor, choose your target and click **Capabilities**. In the **Push Notifications** section, click the switch to turn it from OFF to ON.

[!include[](apns-setup.md)]

For more information, refer to the [Apple documentation](http://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev11b059073).

#### [Optional] Enable silent notifications

[!include[](ios-enable-silent-notifications.md)]

## Add App Center Push to your app

### 1. Add the App Center Push module

The App Center SDK is designed with a modular approach â€“ you only need to integrate the services that you're interested in.

#### Integration via Cocoapods

If you are integrating App Center into your app via Cocoapods, add the following dependency to your podfile and run `pod install`.

```ruby
pod 'MobileCenter/Push'
```

#### Integration by copying the binaries into your project

If you wish to manually integrate the module, follow this [documentation link](ios-manual-integration.md).

### 2.Start App Center Push

In order to use App Center, you need to opt in to the service(s) that you want to use, meaning by default no services are started and you will have to explicitly call each of them when starting the SDK.

#### 2.1 Add the import for App Center Push

Open your **AppDelegate.m** file  in Objective-C or **AppDelegate.swift** file in Swift and add the following import statements:

```objc
@import MobileCenter;
@import MobileCenterPush;
```
```swift
import MobileCenter
import MobileCenterPush
```

#### 2.2 Add the `start:withServices:` method

Add `MSPush` to your `start:withServices:` method to start App Center Distribute together with the other services that you want to use in your app.

Insert the following line to start the SDK in your app's **AppDelegate.m** class in Objective-C or  **AppDelegate.swift** class in Swift in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.

```objc
[MSMobileCenter start:@"{Your App Secret}" withServices:@[[MSPush class]]];
```
```swift
MSMobileCenter.start("{Your App Secret}", withServices: [MSPush.self])
```

Make sure you have replaced `{Your App Secret}` in the code sample above with your App Secret. Please also check out the [Get started](~/sdk/getting-started/ios.md) section if you haven't configured the SDK in your application.

#### 2.3 [Optional] Receive push notifications if you have already implemented `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler` method

If you or one of your third party libraries already implements `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler` method, then follow [step 4](#disable-automatic-forwarding-of-application-delegates-methods-to-mobile-center-services) to implement a callback to receive push notifications.

## Intercept push notifications

You can set up a delegate to be notified whenever a push notification is received in foreground or a background push notification has been tapped by the user. The delegate may also be woken up when a notification is received in background if you have enable [silent notifications](#optional-enable-silent-notifications) and if the payload of the notification contains the [content-available](~/push/index.md#custom-data-in-your-notifications) flag set to true.

>[!NOTE]
>If silent notifications are enabled and you push a notification with `content-available: 1`, then the delegate may be triggered twice for the same notification: when the notification is received in background and when it is tapped.

By default, iOS does not generate notifications when the push is received in foreground, you can use the delegate to customize the push experience when received in foreground or do a specific action when the application is launched by clicking on the push notification when received in background.

You need to register the delegate before starting MobileCenter as shown in the following example:

```objc
[MSPush setDelegate:self];
[MSMobileCenter start:@"{Your App Secret}" withServices:@[[MSPush class]]];
```
```swift
MSPush.setDelegate(self)
MSMobileCenter.start("{Your App Secret}", withServices: [MSPush.self])
```

Here is an example of the delegate implementation that displays an alert dialog when the message is received in foreground or a background push notification has been clicked:

```objc
- (void)push:(MSPush *)push didReceivePushNotification:(MSPushNotification *)pushNotification {
  NSString *title = pushNotification.title;
  NSString *message = pushNotification.message;
  NSMutableString *customData = nil;
  for (NSString *key in pushNotification.customData) {
    ([customData length] == 0) ? customData = [NSMutableString new] : [customData appendString:@", "];
    [customData appendFormat:@"%@: %@", key, [pushNotification.customData objectForKey:key]];
  }
  if (UIApplication.sharedApplication.applicationState == UIApplicationStateBackground) {
    NSLog(@"Notification received in background, title: \"%@\", message: \"%@\", custom data: \"%@\"", title, message,
          customData);
  } else {
    message = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@%@%@", (message ? message : @""), (message && customData ? @"\n" : @""),
                                         (customData ? customData : @"")];
    UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:title
                                                    message:message
                                                   delegate:self
                                          cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"
                                          otherButtonTitles:nil];
    [alert show];
  }
}
```
```swift
func push(_ push: MSPush!, didReceive pushNotification: MSPushNotification!) {
  let title: String? = pushNotification.title
  var message: String = pushNotification.message ?? ""
  var customData: String = ""
  for item in pushNotification.customData {
    customData =  ((customData.isEmpty) ? "" : "\(customData), ") + "\(item.key): \(item.value)"
  }
  if (UIApplication.shared.applicationState == .background) {
    NSLog("Notification received in background, title: \"\(title ?? "")\", message: \"\(message)\", custom data: \"\(customData)\"");
  } else {
    message =  message + ((customData.isEmpty) ? "" : "\n\(customData)")
    let alert = UIAlertView(title: title, message: message, delegate: self, cancelButtonTitle: "OK")
    alert.show()
  }
}
```

## Enable or disable App Center Push at runtime

You can enable and disable App Center Push at runtime. If you disable it, the SDK will stop updating the device token used to push but the existing one will continue working. In other words, disabling the App Center Push in the SDK will **NOT** stop your application from receiving push notifications.

```objc
[MSPush setEnabled:NO];
```
```swift
MSPush.setEnabled(false)
```

To enable App Center Push again, use the same API but pass `YES`/`true` as a parameter.

```objc
[MSPush setEnabled:YES];
```
```swift
MSPush.setEnabled(true)
```

## Check if App Center Push is enabled

You can also check if App Center Push is enabled or not:

```objc
BOOL enabled = [MSPush isEnabled];
```
```swift
var enabled = MSPush.isEnabled()
```

## Disable automatic forwarding of application delegate's methods to App Center services

App Center uses swizzling to automatically forward your application delegate's methods to App Center services to improve SDK integration. There is a possibility of conflicts with other third party libraries or the application delegate itself. In this case, you might want to disable the App Center application delegate forwarding for all App Center services by following the steps below:

1. Open your **Info.plist file**.
2. Add `MobileCenterAppDelegateForwarderEnabled` key and set the value to `0`. This will disable application delegate forwarding for all App Center services.
3. Implement the callbacks to register push notifications

    Implement the `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:` callback and the `application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:` callback in your `AppDelegate` to register for Push notifications.

    ```objc
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application
        didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {

      // Pass the device token to MSPush.
      [MSPush didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
    }

    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application
        didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(nonnull NSError *)error {

      // Pass the error to MSPush.
      [MSPush didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
    }
    ```
    ```swift
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {

      // Pass the device token to MSPush.
      MSPush.didRegisterForRemoteNotifications(withDeviceToken: deviceToken)
    }

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {

      // Pass the error to MSPush.
      MSPush.didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError(error)
    }
    ```

4. Implement the callback to receive push notifications

    Implement the `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler` callback to forward push notifications to the Push service.

    ```objc
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application
        didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
              fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler {
      BOOL result = [MSPush didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo];
      if (result) {
        completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData);
      } else {
        completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNoData);
      }
    }
    ```
    ```swift
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any], fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {
      let result: Bool = MSPush.didReceiveRemoteNotification(userInfo)
      if result {
        completionHandler(.newData)
      }
      else {
        completionHandler(.noData)
      }
    }
    ```
