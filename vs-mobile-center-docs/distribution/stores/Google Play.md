## Google Play Store Distribution 

You can now publish an upgrade to an existing app in Google play store from Mobile Center.

### Google Pre-requisites

* The first version of your Google Play application has been published through Google console.
* A Google Play Developer account. If you don’t have one, register for a Google play developer account at
<https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup>
* Mobile center uses the Google API’s to enable users to publish an update. In order for Mobile center to access these API’s on user’s behalf, you need to create a API project and a Service account. This is an account that belongs to an application, not user, and will be used in creating the store connection in Mobile Center.

For more information on how to use the Google Play Console please use the following link:
<https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435?hl=en>

### Linking your API Project

Before you can access the API, you must link your Google Play Console to an API project. In most cases, we recommend that you create a new API project, though current API users can link to an existing API project. Keep in mind that each API project can only be linked to a single Google Play Console account.

**Creating a new API project**

* Go to the [API Access](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/#ApiAccessPlace) page on the Google Play Console.
* Accept the Terms of Service.
* Click on "Create new project".
* An API project is automatically generated and linked to your Google Play Console.

**Using an existing API project**

* If you are already a user of the Google Play Developer API, you can link to your existing API project by following these steps. If the API project you want to link to is not listed, verify that your Google Play Console account is designated as an Owner, and the Google Play Developer API is enabled.
* Go to the [API Access](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/#ApiAccessPlace) page on the Google Play Console.
* Accept the API Terms of Service.
* Choose the project you’d like to link.
* Click on "Link".


###Setting Up API Access Clients
**Using a service account**

You can also create a [service account](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2ServiceAccount) to access the API from a build server without providing your personal user credentials:

*   Go to the [API Access](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/#ApiAccessPlace) page on the Google Play Console.

*   Under **Service Accounts**, click **Create Service Account**.

*   Follow the instructions on the page to create your service account.

*   On click of [Google API Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/#ApiAccessPlace) link. Proceed by clicking **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.

    1. Configure it as

    2. Choose a name for your Service Account and click **Select a role** drop-down menu. select **Owner** (full access to the integration) under **Project**<img src="../images/image6.png">

    3. Choose a **JSON Key Type**, by clicking on "Furnish a new private key".
<img src="../images/image7.png">

    4. Click **Create**, and you are done.

    **Note:** As you have chosen a JSON Key Type, a file with a .json extension will be downloaded on your machine. ***You will need this file for publish your application***

*   Once you’ve created the service account on the Google Developers Console, click **Done**. The [API Access](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/#ApiAccessPlace) page automatically refreshes, and your service account will be listed.
<img src="../images/image8.png">

*   Click **Grant Access** to provide the service account the necessary rights to perform actions.

    At this point, you should be able to access the API through the service account. For more information, see [Using OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2ServiceAccount).

**You are now done with the Google pre-requisites and ready to publish an update to the Play store from Mobile Center**

### Step1: Create a Store in Mobile Center

Now that you have all your account credentials, you can create a Distribution store.

1. Click on **Stores** under Distribution. 
2. Click on **Add Connection**.
3. Select the store type you want to connect to
4. Select Google Play store and click **Next.**
5. You will need to upload the **private key JSON** file which you downloaded to your machine while creating the service account.

    **Note:** If the JSON fields are edited to incorrect values, your creation of store might fail. Please make sure you have your service account linked to your Google play Developer console as mentioned in the pre-requisite section above. If not linked, your store creation will fail.

6. Once you upload, click **Connect**.
7. You are now connected, and you should now be able to see a store by the name **GooglePlay-Production** store in the **stores** home page.

### Step 2: Publish to Google Play Store

1. From the **stores** home page select GooglePlay-Production store created above.
2. Click on **Publish to store**.
3. Upload the application package and enter release notes.
 **Note:**
    * Application type should be correct and should be signed with a valid key store before uploading.
    * Google Play store supports a maximum of 100 MB of application package. If your application exceeds 100 Mb, use the Expansion files to support the application package by uploading those directly in the google play developer console as we currently don’t support Expansion files in Mobile Center. For more information on Expansion files, check out the link here:   
    <https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/2481797?hl=en>
    * The version of the .apk must be strictly greater than the current version in production.
    * If you have app versions in other tracks like Alpha and Beta, your release version should be strictly less than versions in alpha and Beta track versions
4. Once the package has been uploaded you should be able to see some details of the application. Click **Next** to go to the next page.
5. Click on **Publish** to push the app to the **Google Play store**. The status for this release on the store details page will show as **Submitted.**
6. Once mobile center has completed the hand-over of the app to Google, the status of the app will change to **Published.**
7. In case of a failure while publishing by Google, app owner will receive a notiifcation at google mail.
