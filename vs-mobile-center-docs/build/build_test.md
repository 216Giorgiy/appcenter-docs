# Testing your app

You can leverage our Test service to make sure your latest build starts on a real device. The service works for [iOS](ios/build-test-integration/index.md) & [Android](Android/build-test-integration/index.md) builds. 

While in limited preview, some of the features might not be available to all users. If you have interest in a specific feature, but you cannot find it in the UI, contact us to get access to the latest bits.
