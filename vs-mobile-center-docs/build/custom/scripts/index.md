# Build scripts
You can add up to three custom build steps that run at pre-defined stages during build time. Place the scripts with the respective format next to the project-level (**.xcodeproj**, **build.gradle**, **.csproj**, **.sln** or **package.json**) file that you've selected in the build configuration and we will run them as custom build steps. For iOS and Android apps, we support Bash scripts, for UWP apps we support PowerShell scripts. If one of your scripts is failing, the whole build will fail. This way we ensure it won’t fail at a later time and therefore saves you build time.

>[!NOTE]
> Once your build scripts have been detected for the first time or you moved them to a different location, make sure to save the branch configuration to apply the changes!

## Post-clone
The post-clone script runs immediately after the repository was cloned but before we do anything else on our end.

To run scripts post-clone, add the following file next to the project file in your repository:

- **mobile-center-post-clone.sh** (Bash for iOS & Android)

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # Example: Clone a required repository
    git clone https://github.com/example/SomeProject

    # Example: Install App Center CLI
    npm install -g mobile-center-cli
    ```

- **mobile-center-post-clone.ps1** (PowerShell for UWP)

## Pre-build
The pre-build script runs before the actual build starts, but after we have installed dependencies from e.g. NuGet, CocoaPods or Carthage.

To run scripts pre-build, add the following file next to the project file in your repository:

- **mobile-center-pre-build.sh** (Bash for iOS & Android)

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # Example: Change bundle name of an iOS app for non-production
    if [ "$MOBILECENTER_BRANCH" != "master" ];
    then
        plutil -replace CFBundleName -string "\$(PRODUCT_NAME) Beta" $MOBILECENTER_SOURCE_DIRECTORY/MyApp/Info.plist
    fi
    ```

- **mobile-center-pre-build.ps1** (PowerShell for UWP)

## Post-build
The post-build script runs after the build has finished and we have copied all the necessary artifacts to the output directory.

To run scripts post-build, add the following file next to the project file in your repository:

- **mobile-center-post-build.sh** (Bash for iOS & Android)

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    HOCKEYAPP_API_TOKEN={API_Token}
    HOCKEYAPP_APP_ID={APP_ID}

    # Example: Upload master branch app binary to HockeyApp using the API
    if [ "$MOBILECENTER_BRANCH" == "master" ];
    then
        curl \
        -F "status=2" \
        -F "ipa=@$MOBILECENTER_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/MyApps.ipa" \
        -H "X-HockeyAppToken: $HOCKEYAPP_API_TOKEN" \
        https://rink.hockeyapp.net/api/2/apps/$HOCKEYAPP_APP_ID/app_versions/upload
    else
        echo "Current branch is $MOBILECENTER_BRANCH"
    fi
    ```

- **mobile-center-post-build.ps1** (PowerShell for UWP)
