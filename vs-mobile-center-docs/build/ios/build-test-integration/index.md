# Testing on Real Devices

In this document, you'll learn how to run a successful build on a test device using our Test service.

## Before you start

* Configure your branch accordingly to your choice of programming language (Swift, Xamarin.iOS etc.)
* Sign your code
* Activate a free trial or use your existing subscription

To configure your branch see here [Configure a build](../first-build/index.md) and for signing go to [Code signing](../code-signing/index.md).

Before you can start the integration between our Build & Test service, you need a subscription to our Test service. If you're a first-time user of Mobile Center Test, there's a free trial so you can see how it works. To activate your free trial, you can use the link below the _Run a launch test on a device_.

## Start testing

With all the hard work done it's time to enable testing, all youâ€™ll need to do is revisit the branch settings and enabled _Run a launch test on a device_ and apply changes. In the new build, there will be two portions, both a build and a test, so it's normal to have prolonged build time. The benefit is that you know whether your app starts on a physical device.

Finding your test can be done in two ways: 

1. Wait for an e-mail containing the test result 
2. Go to _Test_ in the left-hand menu and follow along in the progress.

## Unsupported scenarios

* Simulator builds for Xamarin apps
