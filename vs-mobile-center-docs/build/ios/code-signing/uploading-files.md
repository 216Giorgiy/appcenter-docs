# Uploading the code signing files

To sign your iOS builds, upload a provisioning profile (.mobileprovision) and your certificate (.p12 file) when [configuring the build](~/build/ios/first-build/index.md), along with the password you have set for the certificate. These files can be found in the [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/account/), under Certificates, IDs & Profiles.

# Uploading your provisioning profile
1. Once on the "Certificates, IDs & Profiles" page, click on "Provisioning Profiles".
2. Select the provisioning profile you are planning to use for signing your app with in Mobile Center and download it. Make sure to select the right type of certificate (development or distribution).

3. After saving the provisioning profile locally (in a .mobileprovision file), you can upload it to Mobile Center when [configuring a branch](~/build/ios/first-build/index.md).
