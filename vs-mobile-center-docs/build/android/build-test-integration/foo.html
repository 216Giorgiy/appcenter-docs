<p>In this document, you'll learn how to run a successful build on a test device using our Test service.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-start">Before you start</h2>
<ul>
<li>Configure your branch accordingly to your choice of programming language (Java, Xamarin.iOS etc.)</li>
<li>Activate a free trial or use your existing subscription</li>
</ul>
<p>To configure your branch see here <a href="../first-build/index.md">Configure a build</a>.</p>
<p>Before you can start the integration between our Build &amp; Test service, you need a subscription to our Test service. If you're a first-time user of Mobile Center Test, there's a free trial so you can see how it works. To activate your free trial, you can use the link below the <em>Run a launch test on a device</em>.</p>
<h2 id="start-testing">Start testing</h2>
<p>With all the hard work done it's time to enable testing, all youâ€™ll need to do is revisit the branch settings and enabled <em>Run a launch test on a device</em> and apply changes. In the new build, there will be two portions, both a build and a test, so it's normal to have prolonged build time. The benefit is that you know whether your app starts on a physical device.</p>
<p>Finding your test can be done in two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Either you wait for an e-mail with the test result</li>
<li>Go to <em>Test</em> in the left-hand menu and follow along in the progress.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>If your build creates multiple .apks our service doesn't know which binary is the correct</p></li>
<li><p>Simulator builds for Xamarin apps</p></li>
</ul>
