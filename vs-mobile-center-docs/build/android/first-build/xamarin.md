# Xamarin.Android Build

To start building an app, you will firstly need to connect to your GitHub account, select a repository and a branch where your app lives and then you can set up your first build. Choose the Android project that you would like to build; for the app to run on a real device, the build needs to be code signed with a valid KeyStore.

## 1. Linking your repository
If you haven't previously connected to your GitHub account, you will firstly need to do that. Once your GitHub account is connected, select the repository where your Android project is located. In order to setup a build for a repository, you need admin and pull rights for it.

## 2. Selecting a branch
Next step once you have selected a GitHub repository is to select the branch you want to build. By default all the active branches will be listed. Upon selecting the branch you want to get started with, it is time to setup your first build!

## 3. Configuring Your Build

To kick off the first build, configure how the Android project should get built.

### 3.1. Build triggers

By default a new build is triggered on every push a developer does to the configured branch. This is often referred as “Continuous Integration”. If you prefer to manually trigger a new build, you can change this setting in the configuration pane.

### 3.2. Project and Configuration

The available projects in your repository will populate. Select the correct project for your Android build and select the appropriate configuration.

### 3.3. Code signing

A successful build will produce an apk file. In order to release the build to the Play Store, it needs to be signed with a valid Keystore and Alias. To sign the builds produced from a branch, enable code signing in the configuration pane, upload your Keystore, and provide the values needed in the configuration pane. You can read more about code signing [here](~/build/android/code-signing/setup.md).

### 3.4. NuGet restore
If the **NuGet.config** file is checked-in into the repository and sitting next to the **.sln** or at the root, Mobile Center will auto-restore the NuGet feed. Currently Mobile Center only supports NuGet feed v2.

### 3.4. Distribution to a distribution group

You can configure each successful build from a branch to be distributed to a previously created distribution group. You can add a new distribution group from within the Distribute section. There is always a default distribution group called "Collaborators" that includes all the users who have access to the app.

Once you save the configuration, a new build will be automatically kicked off.

## 4. Build results

After a build has been triggered, it can be in the following states:

* **queued** -  the build is in a queue waiting for resources to be freed up
* **succeeded** - the build is completed and it has succeeded
* **failed** - the build has completed but it has failed; you can troubleshoot what went wrong by downloading and inspecting the build log
* **canceled** - the build has been canceled by a user action or it has timed out

### 4.1. Build logs

For a completed build (succeeded or failed), download the logs to understand more about how the build went. Mobile Center povides an archive with the following files:

```
|-- 1_build.txt (this is the general build log)
|-- build (this folder contains a separate log file for each build step)
    |-- <build-step-1>
    |-- <build-step-2>
    |--
    |-- <build-step-n> (e.g. n_Post Job Cleanup.txt)
```

The build step specific logs (located in the build/ directory of the archive) are helpful for troubleshooting and understanding in what step and why the build failed.

### 4.2. The app (.apk)

The .apk is an Android application packaged file which stores the Android app. If the build has been correctly signed, the .apk can be installed on a real device and deployed to the Play Store. If the build has not been signed, the .apk can be run on an emulator or used for other purposes.
