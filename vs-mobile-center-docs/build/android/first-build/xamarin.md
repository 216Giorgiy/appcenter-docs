# Xamarin.Android Build
To start building an app, first of all, you need to connect to your repository service (GitHub, Bitbucket) account, select a repository and a branch where your app lives and then you can set up your first build. Choose the Android project that you would like to build; for the app to run on a real device, the build needs to be code signed with a valid KeyStore.

## 1. Linking your repository
If you haven't done it previously already, first of all, you have to connect your repository service (GitHub, Bitbucket) account. Once your account is connected, select the repository where your Android project is located. In order to setup a build for a repository, you need admin and pull rights for it.

## 2. Selecting a branch
Next step once you have selected a repository is to select the branch you want to build. By default all the active branches will be listed. Upon selecting the branch you want to get started with, it is time to setup your first build!

## 3. Configuring Your Build

To kick off the first build, configure how the Android project should get built.

### 3.1. Build triggers

By default a new build is triggered on every push a developer does to the configured branch. This is often referred to as “Continuous Integration”. If you prefer to manually trigger a new build, you can change this setting in the configuration pane.

### 3.2. Project and Configuration

The available projects in your repository will populate. Select the correct project for your Android build and select the appropriate configuration.

### 3.3. Code signing

A successful build will produce an apk file. In order to release the build to the Play Store, it needs to be signed with a valid Keystore and Alias. To sign the builds produced from a branch, enable code signing in the configuration pane, upload your Keystore, and provide the values needed in the configuration pane. You can read more about code signing [here](~/build/android/code-signing/setup.md).

### 3.4. Launch your successful build on a real device
Use your newly produced APK file to test if your app starts on a real device. This will add approximately 10 more minutes to the total build time. Read more about it [here](~/build/build-test-integration.md)

### 3.5. NuGet restore
If the **NuGet.config** file is checked-in into the repository and sitting next to the **.sln** or at the root, Mobile Center will auto-restore the NuGet feed. Currently Mobile Center only supports NuGet feed v2.

### 3.6. Distribution to a distribution group

You can configure each successful build from a branch to be distributed to a previously created distribution group. You can add a new distribution group from within the Distribute section. There is always a default distribution group called "Collaborators" that includes all the users who have access to the app.

Once you save the configuration, a new build will be kicked off automatically.

## 4. Build results

After a build has been triggered, it can be in the following states:

* **queued** -  the build is in a queue waiting for resources to be freed up
* **building** - the build is running and performing the predefined tasks
* **succeeded** - the build is completed and it has succeeded
* **failed** - the build has completed but it has failed; you can troubleshoot what went wrong by downloading and inspecting the build log
* **canceled** - the build has been canceled by a user action or it has timed out

### 4.1. Build logs

For a completed build (succeeded or failed), download the logs to understand more about how the build went. Mobile Center provides an archive with the following files:

```
|-- 1_build.txt (this is the general build log)
|-- build (this folder contains a separate log file for each build step)
    |-- <build-step-1>
    |-- <build-step-2>
    |--
    |-- <build-step-n> (e.g. n_Post Job Cleanup.txt)
```

The build step specific logs (located in the build/ directory of the archive) are helpful for troubleshooting and understanding in what step and why the build failed.

### 4.2. The app (.apk)

The APK is an Android application packaged file which stores the Android app. If the build has been correctly signed, the APK can be installed on a real device and deployed to the Play Store. If the build has not been signed, the APK can be run on an emulator or used for other purposes.

## Supported versions and requirements
Mobile Center supports Portable Class Library (PCL) projects, but does not currently support .NET Standard.
Mobile Center has no support for Components from the Xamarin Component Store and we advise using NuGet packages whenever they are available. If you are using a Component which cannot be replaced, please reach out to us: click on the blue bubble on the bottom right corner once you're logged in to Mobile Center and share your feedback with us.
