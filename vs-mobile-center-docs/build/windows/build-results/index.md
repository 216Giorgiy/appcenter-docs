# Results for Windows builds
The build results give you rich information about the status of your build. You can download your succeeded build or only the symbols to use for crash reporting. In case of failure you can investigate the logs to solve build issues.

A detailed description of the build results can be found on the platform-specific pages:
* [UWP C#](uwp.md)

While in limited preview, some of the features might not be available to all users. If you have interest in a specific feature, but you cannot find it in the UI, contact us to get access to the latest bits.
