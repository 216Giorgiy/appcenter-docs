# Creating and managing Organizations

## Creating an Organization

To create an app, log in and click the **Add new** dropdown and choose **Add new organization**.

## Accessing Organizations

All of your organizations are accessible in the left navigation. There you will see all **Apps** where you participate, and **People** you collaborate with. Additionally, if you are an organization Admin, you will see a **Manage** option.

## Organization roles

There are two roles within an **Organization**:

**Admins** can manage organization settings (e.g. change name, change permissions). Admins additionally have a **Manager** permission on all apps within the organization.

**Collaborators** can create apps and participate in apps they belong to within organization.

To change the permission of a organization Collaborator, select a user and then use the dropdown to re-assign the role. Only **Admins** can change Collaborator permissions.

Note: When you create an Organization, you automatically become an **Admin**.

## Adding Collaborators to an Organization

There are two ways to add users to an organization:

* Directly to the Collaborators list
    * Select the organization, and then click on the **People** tab in the left navigation. Add Collaborators by typing in the user's email address.
    * This gives the user access to the Organization and allows the Collaborator to create apps.
* In-directly through an App
    * Select an app within an organization and then click **Manage app**. Add Collaborators by typing in the user's email address.
    * Adding a user from outside the organization to an app automatically adds them to the organization.

## Removing Collaborator from Organization

Select the organization, and then click on the **People** tab in the left navigation. Select the Collaborator and then click **Remove from organization**. This action removes the user from all apps within the organization.

## Leaving an Organization

To leave an organization, click on your avatar and navigate to **Settings**. From there, select **Organizations**. There you can click **Leave** on any organization you belong to.

Note: If you the sole Admin of an organization, you cannot **Leave** the organization. You can either promote another Collaborator to Admin or delete the organization.

## Deleting an Organization

To delete an organization, select the organization, and then click on **Manage**. From there, click on **Delete Organization**.

Note: Only organization Admins can delete organizations.
