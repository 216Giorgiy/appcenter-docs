# Dashboard

## Creating an App

To create an app, log in and click **Create new app**.


## Access an App

### Current Version

For the current version of Mobile Center, app sharing access is limited to sharing an individual app with individual users.

To do so, select an app and then click **Manage app**, then type the user's email address in the **Collaborators** box and hit **enter**.

### Future of App Access

We are working on easier methods of giving the correct people access to the correct apps.
