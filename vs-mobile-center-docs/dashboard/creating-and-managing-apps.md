# Creating and managing Apps

## Creating an App

To create an app, log in and click **Add new** dropdown and choose **Add new app**. You can choose the ownership of the app in the modal to either yourself, or to an **Organization** you belong to.

## Accessing Apps

All apps you belong to can be found in **My Apps**. When looking for apps owned by Organizations you belong to, click on the Organization in the left navigation.

## App roles

On each app there are three roles:

**Managers** can manage app settings, collaborators, and integrations.

**Developers** can manage app services (e.g. create builds, run tests).

**Viewers** can view and download all data but cannot make changes.

To change the permission of a Collaborator, select an app and then click **Manage app** and use the dropdown to re-assign the role. Only **Managers** can change Collaborator permissions.

Note: Every app that you create, whether it be owned by you or an organization, you automatically become a **Manager**.

## Adding Collaborators to Apps

To share your app with others, select an app and then click **Manage app** to add **Collaborators** by typing in the user's email address.

Note: If you are not a **Manager** role on an app, you cannot add **Collaborators** to that app.
