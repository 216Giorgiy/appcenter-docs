# Starting a Test Run

This section provides instructions for initiating a test run with test suites that have been prepared for upload. To learn how to prepare a test suite for upload to Test Cloud, see [preparing tests for upload](/test-cloud/preparing-tests-for-upload).

Initiating a test run in Test Cloud requires the [Mobile Center CLI tool](/cli/).

With the Mobile Center CLI tool installed and upload preparation complete, initiating a test run is very straightforward as the UI will guide you through the necessary steps. Begin by navigating to the Test Cloud section within the desired app. Clicking the **new test run** button will launch a dialog which will lead you through the 3 steps of preparing a test run.

### Device selection
Select the devices against which this test run should execute. This collection of devices can optionally be saved as a set for future use. To save the set, follow the on-screen prompts.

### Test run configuration
Select the test framework, set the device locale, and select a test series. Device locale will determine the system-level device settings, such as language. For more on test series, see [this section](/test-cloud/core-concepts).

### The generated command
Each selection from the previous steps will be used to generate a command which is used with the Mobile Center CLI to initiate a test run. For example, a command generated for an Android app with Espresso tests might look like:

```
mobile-center test run espresso --app "mobile-center-username/app-name" --devices a32b320b --app-path pathToFile.apk  --test-series "master" --locale "en_US" --build-dir pathToEspressoBuildFolder
```
