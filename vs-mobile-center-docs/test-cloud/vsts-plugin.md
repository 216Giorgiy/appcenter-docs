# Add UI tests to your VSTS builds

With the Mobile Center Test task for Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), you can run your Appium, Espresso and Xamarin.UITest test suite in Mobile Center Test. It's the next generation of Xamarin Test Cloud task which also is available in VSTS. You can read more about the the frameworks on the [Supported frameworks](supported-frameworks.md) page. 

Each framework will have its own section in this document, where you can read about the basic requirements for setting up a build step definition in VSTS.

![Task](images/vsts-task.png)

## Appium

Before you can start testing using Appium Java, there's prerequisite steps.
* You'll need the application binary (`.apk` or `.ipa` file)
* Activate your trial for Mobile Center Test, this is done on [Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com/). First select your app and then select Test in the left-hand menu.
* Prepare your repository for Appium, read more [here](preparing-for-upload/appium.md).

### VSTS setup
![General](images/vsts-appium-general.png)

You start by adding the Mobile Center Test task to your build definition. The Mobile Center task there is divided up into sections, we'll focus on general, prepare and run test sections. In the general section it's required to insert the path to your app binary (`.apk` or `.ipa`) in `Binary Application File Path` field.

![Prepare](images/vsts-appium-prepare.png)

Under the Prepare Tests section, first make sure the `Prepare Tests` checkbox is checked and that Appium is chosen under `Test Framework`. Insert the path to the Appium test-classes, dependency-jars and the `pom.xml` file into the `Build directory` field. It's usually located in the `upload` folder.

![New test run](images/vsmc-appium-new.png)

If everything is done correctly in the above steps the repository is ready to run the test suite on Mobile Center Tests devices. You'll need to configure your test run, all the information needed is found by creating a new test under Test in Mobile Center. Navigate your browser to [Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com/) and select your app. Go to the Test service and click on `New test run` in the upper right hand side of the screen

![Device selection](images/vsmc-devices.png)

Select your devices, the general rule of a device selection is that more devices equal longer testing time. Start small with 1-3 devices, and when everything is working, create a new test run with more devices. Finish your selection by clicking next.

![Configuration](images/vsmc-appium-configuration.png)

On the next page select your test series or create a new one. Test series is a way of managing your test runs. If VSTS or Test makes more sense, you can use that and later change it to your existing test series. Select Appium as framework and click `Next` to proceed.

![Submit](images/vsmc-appium-submit.png)

Leave the submit page (last page on test run setup) open, as there's information needed for setting up the test run on VSTS. 

![Run](images/vsts-appium-run.png)

* First step is creating a Mobile Center connection, see the [Connecting to Mobile Center](#connecting-to-mobile-center-test) section of this document.
* The app slug is structure as `<username>/<appname>` insert that into the `App Slug` field. On the submit page it's the `--app` parameter
* Your device selection which is a mixture of letters and numbers, is inserted in the `Devices` field. On the submit page it's the `--devices` parameter.
* Test series is a free text and as explained it can be anything. It's the `--test-series` parameter
* System Language is a drop-down menu, and if `Other` is selected a `Other Locale` field appears where you can input laguage and country code like this: en_US

You can read more about starting a test run on the [Starting a test run](start-a-test-run.md) page.

You're all set to queue up the build.

## Espresso
Before you can start testing using Espresso, there's prerequisite steps. You'll need to built an Android application with the Espresso tests (apk file), you need to activate your trial for Mobile Center Test, this is done on [Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com/) and select Test in the left-hand menu. And you need to prepare your repository, read more [here](preparing-for-upload/espresso.md).

### VSTS setup
Inside the VSTS step definition there is 5 section where we'll focus on the first 2, which is general and run test. In the general section there's two options, and we only need to fill the `Binary Application File Path` field with the path to your app binary (`.apk`). Usually this is `<project>/build/outputs/apk`.

If everything is done correctly in the above steps we're ready to run the test on Mobile Center Tests devices. You'll need to configure your test run, you can read about that on the [Starting a test run](starting-a-test-run.md) page.

By now you have your app slug, device selection, system language and test series. The app slug is normally something similiar to `username/appname` fill the `App Slug` with that and your device selection which is a mixture of letters and numbers, this is inserted in the `Devices` field. Your test series is a free text which can be anything, normally it starts with Master and you can leave it like that. Lastly we have the system language which is a drop down menu, this is which language the devices running your test is using.

You'll also need to create a Mobile Center connection, you'll need an API token which you can read more about on the [API documentation](../api-docs/index.md) page.
 
You're all set and ready to queue up the build.

## Xamarin.UITest
Before you can start testing using Xamarin.UITest, there's prerequisite steps. You'll need the application binary (apk or ipa file), you need to activate your trial for Mobile Center Test, this is done on [Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com/) and select Test in the left-hand menu. And you need to prepare your repository, read more [here](preparing-for-upload/uitest.md).

### VSTS setup
You start by adding the Mobile Center Test step. Inside the VSTS step definition there is 5 section we'll focus on the first 3, which is _general_, _prepare_ and _run test_. In the general section there's two options, and only information in `Binary Application File Path` is necessary. Insert the path to your app binary (`.apk` or `.ipa`).

Under the Prepare Tests section, first make sure `Prepare Tests` is checked on and that UI Test is chosen under `Test Framework`. Your `Build Directory` is normally `<ProjectName>/bin/<configuration>`.

If everything is done correctly in the above steps we're ready to run the test on Mobile Center Tests devices. You'll need to configure your test run, you can read about that on the [Starting a test run](starting-a-test-run.md) page.

By now you have your app slug, device selection, system language and test series. The app slug is normally something similiar to `username/appname` fill the `App Slug` with that and your device selection which is a mixture of letters and numbers, this is inserted in the `Devices` field. Your test series is a free text which can be anything, normally it starts with Master and you can leave it like that. Lastly we have the system language which is a drop down menu, this is which language the devices running your test is using.

You'll also need to create a Mobile Center connection, you'll need an API token which you can read more about on the [API documentation](../api-docs/index.md) page.

Happy testing go and queue up that build.

## General setup steps

### Connecting to Mobile Center Test

It's required to login into Mobile Center before using the service, authenticating is possible using 2 methods. The first method is using an API token, you can aquire one by going to Mobile Center and clicking the cog at the buttom of the left-hand menu.

![Settings](images/vsts-api-cog.png)

Select the API Tokens in the middle menu, and click New API token in the top right hand side of the browser window.

![Middle menu](images/vsts-api-middle.png)

Then give it a name, in my example I called it VSTS. This helps me in the future to identify which service is using the token. And finally click Add new API token.

A windows appears with the token. When you click cose the token will dissappear and not be recoverable, so copy it and store it safely.

![API token](images/vsts-api-token.png)

Back in VSTS, click add nex to the Mobile Center Connection field, I put VSMC into name and the token into the API token field. Finish the setup by clicking close. Make sure your newly created connection appears in the Mobile Center Connection field.

The second method is using your log-in credentials, as if it's the CLI or the Mobile Center page. 

You can find your [username here](https://mobile.azure.com/settings/profile). There is a known bug while logging in using your Microsoft credentials, where you might need to create a specific password for Mobile Center. You can set a [new password here](https://mobile.azure.com/settings/password).
