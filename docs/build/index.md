# App Center Build

The App Center Build service helps you build the mobile apps you and your team are working on, using a secure infrastructure. Forget about configuring build servers locally, complicated configurations and code that builds on a co-worker's machine but not yours.

To get started, you, or a member of your team, logs into App Center and opens an app definition. In the App's Build settings, connect to a source control system, select the repository where the app is located at and then simply set up the desired branch to be built.

App Center supports building apps in Git repositories hosted on:

- Bitbucket
- GitHub
- Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)

App Center does not support Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)

We are constantly adding features and more capabilities to App Center, so check back often for new features.

If you're having trouble with your builds, [contact our dedicated support team](https://intercom.help/appcenter/getting-started/getting-help-with-app-center) using the blue chat icon in the lower-right corner of every App Center page.
