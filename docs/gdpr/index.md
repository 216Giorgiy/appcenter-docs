# General Data Protection Regulation

Visual Studio App Center serves primarily as a data processor and its customers as data controllers. In some limited cases, App Center serves as a data controller with regard to its customers. Put simply, we collect customer data and your customer's data. As such we provide you with two experiences: one where you are the data subject and one where you must accommodate your customers as data subjects. 

In the sections below this one you will find instruction on how to manage your personal data and that of your customers.
