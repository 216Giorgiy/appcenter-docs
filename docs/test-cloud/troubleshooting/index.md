# Troubleshooting

The documents in this section discuss troubleshooting tips for App Center Test.

## Android screenshots

If your App Center Test Reports consistently show blank or scrambled screenshots on Android, the typical cause is that the app has disabled screenshots. The [Android screenshots](troubleshooting-android-screenshots.md) guide explains why that can happen and how to get the screenshots to appear.

## CLI exit codes

The App Center CLI tool returns an exit code which reflects whether App Center Test received the necessary information and if it encountered an error. The [CLI exit codes](troubleshooting-cli-exit-codes.md) guide lists App Center CLI exit codes with an explanation for each.
