# Getting started for testers

Navigating through any new tool can be pretty overwhelming as a tester. There's often so many different elements and hurdles associated with getting builds on your devices, which can ultimately make testing apps a frustrating experience. Due to this, we have created a very simple workflow in App Center for testers. In addition, we've created this guide to aid in any parts of testing in App Center that may seem unclear. We know that testing is an integral part of the app development process so we aim to ensure a smooth and successful experience.

## What is App Center?

App Center is a continuous integration, delivery, and learning solution for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows apps. App Center enables developers to ship apps faster and with more confidence by automating the development life cycle.

App Center offers many different services, but the most relevant for testing is our Distribution service. App Center offers functionality that allows developers to release their application binaries to you, a tester, via download link, the App Center install portal, or our native app (android only).  

This page assumes that you're attempting to get started as a tester and have been invited to test an App Center app. If so, you're in the right place!

## First Steps

Whenever you're first invited to test an app by a developer, you should receive an email notifying you of this. This email includes a button that enables you to create an App Center account if you don't currently have one. If you have an account you can login and view your apps. After logging in, the steps for installing your apps are slightly different depending on the OS you are testing on.

You can create an account before a developer officially invites you to test an application, you can sign up on the [App Center website](https://appcenter.ms/signup)

To get started with installing the app you've been invited to test, please select one of the following:

- [Testing Android Apps](./testing-android.md)
- [Testing iOS Apps](./testing-ios.md)
- [Testing macOS Apps](./testing-macos.md)
