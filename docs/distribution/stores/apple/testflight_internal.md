# Publish an iOS package to TestFlight (Internal Testers)

> [!TIP]
> [Build your app according to Apples guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/submissions/)

1. From the Stores home page select “App Store Connect users”.
2. Click on **Publish to TestFlight** in the upper-right corner.
3. When the package has been uploaded, you should be able to see some details of the application. Click **Next**.
4. Click on **Publish** to push the app to the **App Store Connect users** group in TestFlight. The status for this release on the store details page will show as **Submitted**.
5. Once App Center has completed the hand-over of the app to TestFlight, the status of the app will change to **Published**.
6. In case of a failure while publishing by Apple, the status will change to **Failed** with the appropriate error message.
