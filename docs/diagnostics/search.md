# Search in Diagnostics

In this section, you will learn about the ability to search Diagnostics data in App Center.

## How to use Search

App Center Diagnostics allows you to search for specific crashes. In the Diagnostics overview, click on the magnifying glass to start using Search.

### Search types

App Center searches in the indexed fields, and can be done in two ways:

1. Use the search box to include free text. Note that this text will be searched in just the indexed fields.

2. Use the query builder to specify what fields you want to search on by clicking on the filtering icon.

### Indexed fields

For crash reports:

- User ID
- Method
- Class
- Reason
- Model
- OS Version

For crash groups:

- Method
- Class
- Reason

## Considerations

- The search functionality is available just for crashes data (errors cannot be searched today).
- The maximum number of matching reports we display is 100.
- For now, search results show the last 30 days of data, regardless of the retention settings.
