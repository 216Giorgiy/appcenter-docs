## FAQ

- What tier should I choose?

  - Build: depends on the branches you have configured, number of users in your app, and number of apps within your Org. For example: If you have an org, with 3 apps, maximum of 2 branches each and 5 developers on the team, you might consider starting with 2 concurrent build pipelines to ensure a low queue time and fast development cycle.

  - Test: depends on the number of apps you have, number of tests per day, average length of your tests and number of devices in your device set.

- What is a concurrent device?

  Concurrent devices determine the number of devices you can run tests on simultaneously. For example, with 5 concurrent devices, you can test 5 different device configurations in the same amount of time it would normally take to test 1. Concurrency does not limit the number of devices you can run during a test. For example, a test run on 5 devices with 1 concurrency will run on 1 device at a time to completion. Concurrency applies to all apps within an Org or account.

- What are device hours?

  We measure usage in device hours, which is a calculation of all activities on a device initiated by your test. For example, a 12-minute test suite run on 5 device configurations will consume 60 minutes or 1 device hour. Time spent downloading apps, processing screenshots, and generating test reports do not count as billable time. Device hours are tracked across all apps in the Org or account. Running a 12-minute test on 5 iOS and 5 Android devices would be billed as two device hours toward your monthly total.

- What happens if I upgrade mid-month?

  You will be billed prorated.

- What happens I delete my org during the month?

  You will lose the data from your org and will still pay for the full month.

- What happens if a paid user's subscription has an issue (credit card expiry)?

  Azure will notify you via an email notification first. In App Center, you will be downgraded to the free tier temporarily until the subscription issue is fixed. Once it's fixed we will convert you back to your previously selected paid plan.

- Can I downgrade during the month?

  You can, but it will not take effect until the next calendar month.
