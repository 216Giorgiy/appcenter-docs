# App Center Product Roadmap

This document provides a peek into what's next for [Visual Studio App Center](https://appcenter.ms), and lists the features we are currently committed to delivering. It is not a comprehensive list of all new features, but is intended to provide some visibility into our key investments. Due to the nature of the software development process and the resources we have available to work on these features, we're unable to guarantee delivery dates for these features, but know that we're working hard to make App Center better every day.

## Diagnostics

* Manual bug tracker support - Add support for manually adding a crash group as a bug in a third-party bug tracking tool (e.g. VSTS, Jira, GitHub). This enables developers to track work items outside of App Center.
* ProGuard, NDK support.

## Distribution

* Native App Experience – View and install apps via a dedicated native app experience available for Android and iOS.
* Azure Active Directory (AAD) support – Reuse existing Active Directory Groups to grant access to applications in App Center.
* User metrics for distribution groups.
* Publishing MAM wrapped iOS apps to the Intune store.
* Two-factor authentication for Apple App Store – connect to the Apple App Store with Apple IDs that have two-factor authentication enabled.

## SDK

* Add support for the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) cross-platform game engine. This feature includes supporting Unity apps in the App Center portal and shipping the App Center SDK for Unity.  SDK will support App Center Analytics, Distribution, and Diagnostics at launch.
