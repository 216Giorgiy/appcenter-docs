# Product Roadmap

The list below presents the tentative roadmap for App Center for the next 3-6 months.

## General

* Manual bug tracker support - Add support for manually adding a crash group as a bug in a third-party bug tracking tool (e.g. VSTS, Jira, GitHub). This enables developers to track work items outside of App Center. 

## Distribution service

* Native Apps – View and install apps via a dedicated native app experience available for iOS and Android.
* Azure Active Directory (AAD) support – Reuse your existing Active Directory Groups to grant access in App Center.
* User metrics for distribution groups.
* Publishing MAM wrapped iOS apps to the Intune store.
* Two-factor authentication for Apple App Store – connect to the Apple App Store with Apple IDs that have two-factor authentication enabled.

## Crashes service

* ProGuard, NDK support.

## SDK

* Add support for the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) cross-platform game engine. This feature includes supporting Unity apps in the App Center portal and shipping the App Center SDK for Unity.  SDK will support App Center Analytics, Distribution, and Diagnostics at launch.
