# HockeyApp Transition

In 2017, we announced that HockeyApp features and functionality would move to Visual Studio App Center, a single solution for continuously building, testing, releasing, and monitoring your apps. We’ve spent the last year bringing HockeyApp’s Distribution, Crash Reporting, and Analytics services to App Center, where they join new services exclusive to App Center: Build, Test and Push Notifications. But we didn’t stop there. We continued to build next-generation features - such as iOS auto-provisioning and public app store integrations - that make App Center even better than HockeyApp. Because HockeyApp’s distribution, crash reporting, and analytics services are now available in App Center, HockeyApp will be retired on November 16, 2019. HockeyApp customers will have one year to complete their move to App Center.

## Today: Get started with your transition to App Center 

We’re committed to making this transition seamless for you. With that in mind, we've already migrated your HockeyApp apps to App Center with no risk to your data or disruption to your existing experience in HockeyApp. We’ve built a side-by-side experience that allows you to work in both App Center and HockeyApp with your HockeyApp apps. To get started with the side-by-side experience, simply [sign-in to App Center](https://appcenter.ms/login?utm_medium=referral_link&utm_source=Hockey%20App) using your existing HockeyApp credentials. [Learn more about the side-by-side experience](~/migration/hockeyapp/side-by-side.md). 

## Early 2019: Completing your migration to App Center

While we have migrated your apps from HockeyApp to App Center, your data is still tied to HockeyApp. Starting in early 2019, you will be able to complete your migration by moving all of your apps fully to App Center. This will remove the syncing with HockeyApp, and will give you full control of your apps in App Center. This will also be the moment when you can update your apps to use the new App Center SDK. The App Center SDK is built to be faster and more modular than the HockeySDK. Ship the App Center SDK in a future release, and still receive data from the HockeyApp SDK in App Center from past releases. [Follow our transition plan](https://aka.ms/hockeyapp-transition) for the latest updates.

## November 16, 2019: Farewell, HockeyApp!

After November 16, 2019, all HockeyApp customers will use the next generation of Distribution, Crash Reporting, and Analytics services in App Center and HockeyApp will no longer be accessible. We’re excited about HockeyApp’s future in App Center, and can’t wait for you to experience all the new features in App Center that will greatly improve your ability to quickly deliver high-quality apps.
