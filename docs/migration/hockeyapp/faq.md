# HockeyApp Transition FAQ

## Transition to App Center

**When will my apps arrive in App Center?**

Starting in mid-November all HockeyApp apps and data have been synced with App Center. This allows you to explore new App Center features while still maintaining full control in HockeyApp. Login to App Center using your HockeyApp credentials to see your apps.

**What if I want to continue using HockeyApp?**

You should! Feel free to explore App Center at your own pace.

**Do I need to change my SDK?**

Not yet. Continue to use your HockeySDK and we will push your crashes and analytics into App Center seamlessly.

**Can I use some apps in HockeyApp and move others over to App Center?**

Yes. Feel free to use your apps in both HockeyApp and App Center simultaneously.

**What happens to my HockeyApp data?**

While your distribution history data will be synced to App Center, your crashes and analytics from the HockeySDK will be streamed to App Center. Note that Crash is currently in preview for HockeyApp apps and you will need to join the preview in App Center to start collecting crash data. We will communicate additional options starting in 2018.

**I like a certain feature in HockeyApp. Does App Center have feature-parity with HockeyApp?**

Our goal is to have feature-parity with HockeyApp. [View our roadmap](~/general/roadmap.md) to keep track of this progress. If you have a feature request that is not listed, share it with us using the round blue intercom button located in the lower right corner of all App Center pages.

**When will App Center be ready for me to migrate my apps completely off of HockeyApp?**

We're working on the specific timing, but currently we expect the option to fully migrate off of HockeyApp to App Center to be available in mid-2018.
