# App Center Push

The Visual Studio App Center Push service enables app producers to engage with their users outside of the standard, in-app experience. Once a developer adds the App Center SDK [link] to an application, developers, marketers, and automated processes can send notifications to devices running the application.  

## <a name="app-center-config"/>Configuring App Center for Push Notifications

Configuring Push for your application project is as simple as:

1. Sign-up for a free App Center account at [https://appcenter.ms](https://appcenter.ms).
2. Create a new application project (what we call an app in App Center) or open an existing App project.
3. Select the Push option in the project navigation pane.
4. Configure any required settings for your app’s target platform. For example:
    + Apple iOS devices use the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) to deliver notifications, you’ll have some configuration to do in APNs to enable Push in App Center.
    + Google Android devices use the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service to deliver notification, so you’ll have some configuration to do in Firebase to enable Push in App Center.
5. Copy the appropriate notification service settings into your App Center App project.

For additional information, refer to [Configuring the Push Service](~/push/push-configuration.md).

## <a name="app-config"/>Configuring Your Application for Push

To configure your application to handle push notifications, you’ll add the App Center SDK to your application, then write the code needed to process notifications when they arrive.  

The instructions for doing this varies depending on the target platform. For additional information, refer to the Push SDK platform documentation:

+ [Android SDK documentation](~/sdk/push/android.md)
+ [iOS SDK documentation](~/sdk/push/ios.md)
+ [macOS SDK documentation](~/sdk/push/macos.md)
+ [React Native Android SDK documentation](~/sdk/push/react-native-android.md)
+ [React Native iOS SDK documentation](~/sdk/push/react-native-ios.md)
+ [UWP SDK documentation](~/sdk/push/uwp.md)
+ [Xamarin Android SDK documentation](~/sdk/push/xamarin-android.md)
+ [Xamarin iOS SDK documentation](~/sdk/push/xamarin-ios.md)
+ [Xamarin Forms SDK documentation](~/sdk/push/xamarin-forms.md)

## <a name="device-registration"/>Device Registration

App Center Push can’t just push to any device. When a user runs your Push-enabled app for the first time after installation, the App Center Push SDK initializes and automatically registers the device running the application with the appropriate notification services. It then provides App Center with the information and authorization it needs to send notifications to the device.

## <a name="sending-push"/>Sending Push Notifications

With the Push service configured and devices running your application registered with the proper notification services, you’re ready to send notifications to devices. You’ll send notifications using the following methods:

+ Using the App Center portal.
+ Using the App Center REST API.  

App Center supports the following notification targets:

+ **All registered devices**: all users opted-in will received the notification.
+ **Custom devices list**: send a notification to the list of install IDs. You can get the install IDs by using our SDK API.
+ **Audiences**: the notification will be sent to a segment of your users based on a set of device and custom properties.

For additional information, refer to [Sending Push Notifications](~/push/push-sending.md).
