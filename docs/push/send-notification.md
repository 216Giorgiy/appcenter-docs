# Sending push notifications

The Visual Studio App Center Push service (ACPs) offers two ways to send notifications to registered devices:

+ Using the App Center Portal (described in this document)
+ Using the [App Center Push API](~/push/rest-api.md)

When sending notifications through App Center, you can target destination devices (notification recipients) in the following ways:

+ **All registered devices**: Sends notifications to all registered devices.
+ **Custom devices list**: Sends notifications to up to 20 devices (using the install IDs for the target devices).
+ **Audiences**: Sends notifications to a segment of your app's registered device audience based on a set of device and custom properties. For additional information about creating and managing Audiences, refer to [App Center Push Audiences](~/push/audiences.md).
