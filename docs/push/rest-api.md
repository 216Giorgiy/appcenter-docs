# Using the Push API

The Visual Studio App Center Push (ACP) service offers two ways to send notifications to registered devices:

+ Using the [App Center Portal](~/push/send-notification.md)
+ Using the App Center Push API (described in this document)

When sending notifications through App Center, you can target destination devices (notification recipients) in the following ways:

+ **All registered devices**: Sends notifications to all registered devices.
+ **Custom devices list**: Sends notifications to up to 20 devices (using the install IDs for the target devices).
+ **Audiences**: Sends notifications to a segment of your app's registered device audience. You'll build audiences based on a set of device and custom properties.

App Center follows the philosophy of API-first; you can expect to find API support for every capability exposed through the App Center portal. We have a [swagger](https://openapi.appcenter.ms) as well as documentation on [how to get started with our APIs](~/api-docs/index.md).

## Push API

Sending Push Notifications via API will allow you to automate the process of engaging with your users.
Go to the [Push Swagger](https://openapi.appcenter.ms#push) to see the supported APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> In the Push API calls, "owner_name" could be either the app owner's user id, or the name of the org the app falls under.

## Send notifications via API

In this documentation, we will assume that you already have an app ready to receive push notifications. Follow our Push SDK documentation for the different supported platforms: [Android Push SDK](~/sdk/push/android.md), [iOS Push SDK](~/sdk/push/ios.md), [React Native Android Push SDK](~/sdk/push/react-native-android.md), [React Native iOS Push SDK](~/sdk/push/react-native-ios.md), [UWP Push SDK](~/sdk/push/uwp.md), [Unity Android Push SDK](~/sdk/push/unity-android.md), [Unity iOS Push SDK](~/sdk/push/unity-ios.md), [Unity UWP Push SDK](~/sdk/push/unity-windows.md), [Xamarin Android Push SDK](~/sdk/push/xamarin-android.md), [Xamarin iOS Push SDK](~/sdk/push/xamarin-ios.md), [Xamarin Forms Push SDK](~/sdk/push/xamarin-forms.md), and [macOS Push SDK](~/sdk/push/macOS.md).

### API Tokens

The first thing you will need to do is to create an API Token from your [user settings](https://appcenter.ms/settings/apitokens), as shown in the image below.

![Push API Token](~/push/images/API-tokens.png)

### User and Application

In order to send push notifications, you will need to get the user and the application name. To do so, you can use our APIs [for the user](https://openapi.appcenter.ms/#/account/users_get) and [the application](https://openapi.appcenter.ms/#/account/apps_listForOrg).

Here is an example on how to use this information to send push notifications:

```NA
https://appcenter.ms/api/v0.1/apps/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/<YOUR_APP_NAME>/push/notifications
```

### Send the notification

You can send a push using this [POST push API](https://openapi.appcenter.ms/#/push/Push_Send). The push request body is in JSON format (`application/json` content type). Here is an example:

```JSON
{
 "notification_content" : {
  "name" : "First Push From App Center",
  "title" : "Push From App Center",
  "body" : "Welcome!",
  "custom_data" : {"key1" : "val1", "key2" : "val2"}
  }
}
```

## Campaign

Campaign Name should be 64 characters or less, and title should be 128 characters or less. Otherwise you will get an error 400 Bad Request when sending the push via the API. To ensure you are within the limits, try constructing the name and title from the Campaign UI before pushing it via the API.

## Send notifications to Audiences using API

[Audiences](~/push/send-notification.md#audiences) allow you to segment your user base, built using device, and custom properties.

### Define an audience

In order to define an audience using properties, you use the following symbols:

| Definition                | Symbol  | Equivalent |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| equals                    |    `=`    |     `eq`     |
| not equals                |    `!=`   |     `ne`     |
| less than                 |    `<`    |     `lt`     |
| greater than              |    `>`    |     `gt`     |
| less than or equal to     |    `<=`   |     `le`     |
| greater than or equal to  |    `>=`   |     `ge`     |

### Audiences based on device properties

Send notifications to a group of users that match specific criteria (for example, all users in United States). You can create groups (audiences) based on the device properties and custom properties. To an audience, use [this App Center PUT API](https://openapi.appcenter.ms/#/analytics/Analytics_CreateOrUpdateAudience).

Here is an example for an audience based on a device property where country is `United States`:

```JSON
{
  "definition" : "CarrierCountry eq 'US'",
  "description" : "Users in the United States"
}
```

### Audiences based on custom properties

Here is an example for an audiences based two custom properties (boolean and string properties):

```JSON
{
  "definition": "myBooleanProperty eq true and myStringProperty eq 'myStringValue'",
  "custom_properties": {
    "myBooleanProperty": "boolean",
    "myStringProperty": "string"
  }
}
```

You will need to add this custom properties using our SDK for each platform: [Android API custom properties](~/sdk/other-apis/android.md#use-custom-properties), [iOS API custom properties](~/sdk/other-apis/ios.md), [React Native API custom properties](~/sdk/other-apis/react-native.md#use-custom-properties), [UWP API custom properties](~/sdk/other-apis/uwp.md#use-custom-properties), [Unity API custom properties](~/sdk/other-apis/unity.md#use-custom-properties), [Xamarin API custom properties](~/sdk/other-apis/xamarin.md#use-custom-properties) and [macOS API custom properties](~/sdk/other-apis/macOS.md#use-custom-properties).

### Send push notification to an audience

```JSON
{
 "notification_content" : {
  "name" : "First Push From App Center",
  "title" : "Push From App Center",
  "body" : "Welcome!",
  "custom_data" : {"key1" : "val1", "key2" : "val2"}
  },
    "notification_target" : {
    "type" : "audiences_target",
    "audiences" : ["a-1", "a-2"]
  }
}
```

## Send notifications to Device IDs

This is an example of sending a Push Notifications to a set of Device IDs. To get the install ID, you can use our APIs: [Android APIs](~/sdk/other-apis/android.md), [iOS APIs](~/sdk/other-apis/ios.md), [React Native APIs](~/sdk/other-apis/react-native.md), [UWP APIs](~/sdk/other-apis/uwp.md), [Unity APIs](~/sdk/other-apis/unity.md), [Xamarin APIs](~/sdk/other-apis/xamarin.md) and [macOS APIs](~/sdk/other-apis/macOS.md).

Below, you will find an example where we target the following devices IDs: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`,`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002`, `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003`.

```JSON
{
 "notification_content" : {
  "name" : "First Push From App Center",
  "title" : "Push From App Center",
  "body" : "Welcome!",
  "custom_data" : {"key1" : "val1", "key2" : "val2"}
  },
    "notification_target" : {
    "type" : "devices_target",
    "devices" : ["00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001","00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002", "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003"]
  }
}
```

## Send notifications to all registered devices

This is an example of sending a Push Notifications to all registered devices.

```JSON
{
 "notification_content" : {
  "name" : "First Push From App Center",
  "title" : "Push From App Center",
  "body" : "Welcome!",
  "custom_data" : {"key1" : "val1", "key2" : "val2"}
  },
    "notification_target" : null
}
```
